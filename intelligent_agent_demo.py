    REDDIT AGENT:
    - Learns which keywords find relevant subreddits
    - Adapts search parameters based on success
    - Evolves issue keywords from successful posts
    - Optimizes scraping parameters for quality
    - Remembers what works and what doesn't
    
    SF311 AGENT:
    - Intelligently determines when data is 'good enough'
    - Stops fetching when quality threshold is met
    - Learns optimal page counts for different times
    - Adapts filtering based on successful patterns
    - Balances speed vs quality automatically
    
    BOTH AGENTS:
    - Build memory of successful patterns
    - Avoid repeating failed strategies
    - Continuously improve performance
    - Adapt to changing data patterns
    - Optimize for speed and quality
